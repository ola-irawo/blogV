        content:
          "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health is a state of complete physical, mental and social wellbeing and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity. Based on this definition, it's likely that no one can be called healthy. Even though people are more vocal about their physical illness, that is not the the case when it comes to mental illnesses. A lot of people are hesitant about discussing their mental challenges. Millions of people around the world suffer from mental health illnesses, yet the stigma surrounding these issues prevent people from seeking professional help or even discussing their issues with friends and family. This lack of understanding and support can create feelings of loneliness and isolation, aggravating the already difficult journey toward recovery. Ventmoir recognizes the need for creating a safe place where people with mental health struggles can unburden themselves. By providing a platform for people to share their challenges, experience and survival stories, the goal is to eliminate the isolation struggles associated with mental health challenges.",
