        <h3>The Problem We Aim to Solve</h3>

        <p>
          The prevalence of mental health conditions is staggering, yet a great amount of individuals still struggle to access the support and resources needed. According to the World Health Organization, depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health conditions. Despite these statistics, there is a significant gap in mental health care, with many individuals facing challenges in accessing timely and affordable support.
        </p>

        <p>
          The stigma often associated with mental health often prevents individuals from seeking help or speaking openly about their struggles. This lack of awareness and understanding increase the feelings of isolation and shame, making it more difficult for individuals to reach out for support.  Ventmoir aims to address these challenges by providing a supportive and inclusive platform where individuals can access a range of mental health resources, connect with others with similar experiences, and receive support in their mental health journeys.
